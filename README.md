# Profitable Dungeons

<i>Profitable Dungeons</i> is a free-to-play open-source game developed as part of the final project of the course <a href="https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=SSC0140&codcur=55041&codhab=0">"SSC0140 - Operating Systems I"</a>. Our goal for implementing the game was to practise <i>multi-threading</i>. More information can be found in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CQ72u19udw&t=3s">this</a> video (in Portuguese). In order to play, you can either download the latest release of the game (Windows only) or compile the game from the source code (instructions bellow).


# Instructions for compiling
